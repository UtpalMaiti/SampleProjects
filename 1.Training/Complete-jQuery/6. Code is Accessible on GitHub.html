<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Before we dive into coding with jQuery, I want you to know that the code for each lecture (sometimes in a slightly
    modified form)&nbsp;is&nbsp;available on GitHub
    here:&nbsp;https://github.com/petersommerhoff/jquery-course/tree/master</p>
<p>Each lecture also has a link to the appropriate folder&nbsp;of this repository for reference, so you can quickly
    access it there as well.</p>
<p>The code on GitHub contains lots of documentation which further explains the concepts, such as&nbsp;how and
    why&nbsp;the functions are used. So make sure to check them out to get more comfortable with the concepts presented
    in each lecture.</p>
<p>You can always&nbsp;compare your code with the code in the&nbsp;repository to better find bugs.</p>
<p>That's all, happy coding!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Peter</p>
